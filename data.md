```javascript
let data = {
    user : 
    {
        uId: 1,
        nameFirst: 'Alison',
        nameLast: 'Patman',
        email: 'boost@lol.com.au',
        status: 'Sleeping'
    },
    channel : 
    {
        channelId: 1,
        name: 'boost_chat'
        messages: {} 
    } 
}
```

[Optional] About data structure:


[Future_features]
-messages can filled afterwards in later iterations
{
    messageId: 0,
    uId: 1,
    message: 'Hi everyone',
    timeSent: 1,
}

- We'll have to track the users in a channel either via users : {} or channel : {}
